**	Building responsive and powerful cross-platform applications with PyQt**

## What is this book about?
PyQt is one of the best cross-platform interface toolkits currently available; it's stable, mature, and completely native. If you want control over all aspects of UI elements, PyQt is what you need. This book will guide you through every concept necessary to create fully functional GUI applications using PyQt, with only a few lines of code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Use basic Qt components, such as a radio button, combo box, and sliders 
Use QSpinBox and sliders to handle different signals generated on mouse clicks 
Work with different Qt layouts to meet user interface requirements 
Create custom widgets and set up customizations in your GUI 
Perform asynchronous I/O operations and thread handling in the Python GUI 
Employ network concepts, internet browsing, and Google Maps in UI 
Use graphics rendering and implement animation in your GUI 
Make your GUI application compatible with Android and iOS devices

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QDialog, QApplication
from demoCalendar import *
class MyForm(QDialog):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.ui = Ui_Dialog()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)
        self.ui.calendarWidget.selectionChanged.connect
        (self.dispdate)
        self.show()
    def dispdate(self):
        self.ui.dateEdit.setDate(self.ui.calendarWidget.
        selectedDate())
if __name__=="__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    w = MyForm()
    w.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
